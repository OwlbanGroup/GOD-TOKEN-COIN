# GOD-TOKEN-COIN Development Plan

## Overview
Build a comprehensive financial system pegged to precious metals (gold/silver) with quantum blockchain features, integrating NOVA-BLOCKS components.

## Key Components
- Smart contracts for GOD token (ERC-20) and NFT certificates (ERC-721) backed by gold/silver
- AI-embedded gold interface integration for minting verification
- DeFi frontend (wallet, staking, trading) using NOVA-BLOCKS React app
- Quantum blockchain simulations for security
- Backend APIs using NOVA-BLOCKS finance modules
- Blackwell GPU optimizations

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Smart Contracts
- [ ] Create Solidity contracts for GOD token (ERC-20)
- [ ] Create NFT certificates for precious metal backing (ERC-721)
- [ ] Implement minting/burning logic tied to AI verification
- [ ] Add staking and reward mechanisms

### Phase 2: AI Integration
- [ ] Integrate NOVA-BLOCKS ai_embedded_gold_interface.py for gold verification
- [ ] Add quantum simulation for secure minting
- [ ] Connect to Blackwell GPU benchmarks for performance

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
- [ ] Extend NOVA-BLOCKS React app with DeFi dashboard
- [ ] Add wallet connection (MetaMask)
- [ ] Implement staking interface
- [ ] Add trading/swap components
- [ ] Integrate precious metal price feeds

### Phase 4: Backend APIs
- [ ] Set up Node.js/Express server using NOVA-BLOCKS backend
- [ ] Add finance APIs (trading, lending)
- [ ] Integrate RL trading agents and stock trainers
- [ ] Connect to blockchain networks (Ethereum/Polygon)

### Phase 5: Quantum Features
- [ ] Implement simulated quantum-resistant blockchain features
- [ ] Add quantum state tracking for transactions
- [ ] Optimize with Blackwell quantum simulator

### Phase 6: Testing and Deployment
- [ ] Run Blackwell benchmarks for performance validation
- [ ] Test smart contracts on testnet
- [ ] Deploy frontend and backend
- [ ] Mainnet deployment
- [ ] Documentation and user guides
